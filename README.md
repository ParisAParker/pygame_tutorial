# Pygame Tutorial Project

This repository contains my work as I follow along with a Pygame tutorial from Tech With Tim's youtube channel. The goal is to learn the basics of game development using Pygame.

You can find the tutorial video here: [Pygame in 90 Minutes - For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO6qQDNa2UY)
